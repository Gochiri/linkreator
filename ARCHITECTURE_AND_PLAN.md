# Senior Architect Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report analyzes the current state of the Linkreator project, specifically focusing on the `.claude/commands/design-os` directory and the `product/product-roadmap.md`. 

**Verdict:** The project is currently structured as a highly sophisticated **"Prompt Engineering System"** rather than a traditional software codebase. While excellent for AI-driven ideation, it lacks a concrete execution framework for production software development. The "Export Product" workflow (generating markdown instructions for another AI) introduces unnecessary friction.

**Recommendation:** Transition from "AI Command Structure" to a **Modern full-stack Monorepo** (or modular monolith). Move specifications to a formal `docs/` architecture and implement the roadmap directly as code features, leveraging the existing high-quality definitions.

## 1. Project Structure Analysis

### Current State
*   **Documentation Storage:** Critical product specs (Data Models, Design Tokens, Screen Designs) are hidden in `.claude/commands/design-os`. This ties the project to a specific AI workflow tool (Claude) and obscures the architecture from human developers.
*   **Data Models:** Defined conceptually in Markdown (`data-model.md`) but lacking concrete schema definitions (SQL/Prisma/Typescript).
*   **Implementation Strategy:** The current `export-product.md` suggests a meta-workflow: *Generate instructions -> Give to AI -> Build Code*. This is inefficient.

### Proposed Restructuring
We will transform the repo into a production-ready structure.

    D[product/product-roadmap.md]
    end
    subgraph "Proposed"
    E[apps/web (Next.js)]
    F[packages/ui (Design System)]
    G[docs/specs (Moved from .claude)]
    H[db/schema.prisma (Concrete Data Model)]
    end
```

**Action Items:**
1.  **Migrate Specifications:** Move contents of `.claude/commands/design-os` to `docs/specifications`.
2.  **Formalize Data Model:** Convert `data-model.md` into a real database schema (Prisma/Supabase).
3.  **Centralize Design System:** Move `design-tokens.md` and `design-tokens` logic to a `tailwind.config.ts` and a dedicated UI component library.

## 2. Product Roadmap & Reformulation

The gathered roadmap is ambitious, aiming to be a "Content OS".

**Core Modules:**
1.  **Content Creator** (AI Text) -> *Backend Service (LLM Wrapper)*
2.  **Carousel Builder** (Visual Editor) -> *Frontend Heavy (Canvas API / HTML5 Drag-n-Drop)*
3.  **Image Generator** (AI Image) -> *Backend Service (Image Gen Wrapper)*
4.  **Content Calendar** (Planning) -> *CRUD + Calendar UI*
5.  **Brand & Avatar** (Configuration) -> *User Settings / Profile Management*
6.  **Canvas** (Workspace) -> *Dashboard / Project Management*

**Refined Phases:**
Instead of the previous linear roadmap, we propose an **Architecture-First Approach**:

### Phase 1: The Core Platform (Weeks 1-2)
*   **Goal:** Establish the "OS" foundation.
*   **Tech Stack:** Next.js 14+ (App Router), Supabase (Auth/DB), TailwindCSS.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   App Shell (Sidebar, Navigation, User Menu) - derived from `design-shell.md`.
    *   Authentication (Brand/User Context).
    *   Database Schema V1 (Users, Workspaces, Brands).

### Phase 2: The Content Engines (Weeks 3-4)
*   **Goal:** Enable creation (Text + Image).
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   **Content Creator:** AI Text Generation Pipeline (Vercel SDK / LangChain).
    *   **Image Generator:** Integration with Flux/Midjourney via API.
    *   **Data Layer:** Storing generated assets in Supabase Storage.

### Phase 3: The Editors (Weeks 5-8)
*   **Goal:** Visual manipulation.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   **Carousel Builder:** A complex React-based canvas editor. This is the most technically challenging frontend piece.
    *   **Canvas:** The organizational layer (Folders, Tags).

### Phase 4: Lifecycle Management (Weeks 9-10)
*   **Goal:** Organization and Planning.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   **Content Calendar:** Drag-and-drop scheduling interface.
    *   **Export/Publishing:** Mechanisms to get content OUT of the system.

## 3. Implementation Plan (Next Steps)

Triggering the **Senior Architect** skill execution requires the following immediate actions:

1.  **Initialize Tech Stack**:
    *   Run `create-next-app` (if not already valid).
    *   Install generic UI components (shadcn/ui recommended matching `design-tokens`).

2.  **Schema Definition**:
    *   Translate `data-model.md` into `schema.prisma`.

3.  **Component Scaffolding**:
    *   Create base layout components matching `design-shell.md`.
