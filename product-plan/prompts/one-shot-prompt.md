# One-Shot Implementation Prompt

Copy this prompt and paste it into your coding agent (Claude, Cursor, etc.) to implement FocusAI in one session.

---

I need you to implement a complete web application based on detailed design specifications and UI components I'm providing.

## Instructions

Please carefully read and analyze the following files:

1. **@product-plan/product-overview.md** — Product summary with sections and data model overview
2. **@product-plan/instructions/one-shot-instructions.md** — Complete implementation instructions for all milestones

After reading these, also review:
- **@product-plan/design-system/** — Color and typography tokens
- **@product-plan/data-model/** — Entity types and relationships
- **@product-plan/shell/** — Application shell components
- **@product-plan/sections/** — All section components, types, sample data, and test instructions

## Before You Begin

Please ask me clarifying questions about:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - How should users sign up and log in? (email/password, OAuth providers, magic links?)
   - Are there different user roles with different permissions?
   - Should there be an admin interface?

2. **User & Account Modeling**
   - Is this a single-user app or multi-user?
   - Do users belong to organizations/teams/workspaces?
   - How should user profiles be structured?

3. **Tech Stack Preferences**
   - What backend framework/language should I use?
   - What database do you prefer?
   - Any specific hosting/deployment requirements?

4. **AI Integration**
   - Which LLM provider should I use for the AI Coach? (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Should AI features work offline with cached responses?
   - What's the budget for AI API costs?

5. **Backend Business Logic**
   - How should the Pareto priority be calculated?
   - How should the productivity score algorithm work?
   - Any specific notification/reminder requirements?

6. **Any Other Clarifications**
   - Questions about specific features or user flows
   - Edge cases that need clarification
   - Integration requirements

Lastly, be sure to ask me if I have any other notes to add for this implementation.

Once I answer your questions, create a comprehensive implementation plan before coding.
