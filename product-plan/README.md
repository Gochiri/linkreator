# FocusAI — Design Handoff

This folder contains everything needed to implement FocusAI, an AI-powered productivity coach with task management, goal planning, focus sessions, and a conversational AI assistant.

## What's Included

### Ready-to-Use Prompts
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt for full implementation in one session
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section implementation

### Instructions
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary (provide with every implementation)
- `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` — All milestones combined
- `instructions/incremental/` — 6 milestone instructions:
  - `01-foundation.md` — Design tokens, data model, routing, shell
  - `02-tasks-and-priorities.md` — Task management with Pareto prioritization
  - `03-goals-and-planning.md` — SMART goals and RPM methodology
  - `04-ai-coach.md` — Conversational AI coach panel
  - `05-focus-mode.md` — Pomodoro sessions
  - `06-dashboard.md` — Productivity metrics

### Design Assets
- `design-system/` — Colors (violet, amber, slate), fonts (Space Grotesk, Inter, JetBrains Mono)
- `data-model/` — Core entity types and relationships
- `shell/` — Application shell components (sidebar, nav, user menu)
- `sections/` — 5 section component packages:
  - `tasks-and-priorities/`
  - `goals-and-planning/`
  - `ai-coach/`
  - `focus-mode/`
  - `dashboard/`

Each section includes:
- `README.md` — Feature overview
- `tests.md` — Test-writing instructions for TDD
- `components/` — React components
- `types.ts` — TypeScript interfaces
- `sample-data.json` — Test data
- `screenshot.png` — Visual reference (if available)

## How to Use This

### Option A: Incremental (Recommended)

Build your app milestone by milestone for better control:

1. Copy `product-plan/` to your implementation codebase
2. Start with Foundation (`instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`)
3. For each section:
   - Open `prompts/section-prompt.md`
   - Fill in the section variables
   - Copy/paste into your coding agent
   - Answer questions and implement
4. Review and test after each milestone

### Option B: One-Shot

Build the entire app in one session:

1. Copy `product-plan/` to your codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md`
3. Copy/paste into your coding agent
4. Answer the agent's clarifying questions
5. Let the agent plan and implement everything

## Test-Driven Development

Each section includes a `tests.md` file with test-writing instructions. For best results:

1. Read `sections/[section-id]/tests.md` before implementing
2. Write failing tests based on the instructions
3. Implement the feature to make tests pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green

The test instructions are **framework-agnostic** — they describe WHAT to test, not HOW. Adapt to your testing setup (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, etc.).

## Quick Reference

### Sections & Routes

| Section | Route | Key Features |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Tasks & Priorities | `/tasks` | Pareto prioritization, dependencies, calendar |
| Goals & Planning | `/goals` | SMART goals, RPM, Kanban board |
| AI Coach | (panel) | Chat, proactive suggestions, check-ins |
| Focus Mode | `/focus` | Pomodoro timer, history, streaks |
| Dashboard | `/dashboard` | Score gauge, metrics, insights |

### Design Tokens

- **Primary:** `violet` (buttons, active states)
- **Secondary:** `amber` (streaks, highlights)
- **Neutral:** `slate` (backgrounds, text)
- **Fonts:** Space Grotesk (headings), Inter (body), JetBrains Mono (code)

### Key Data Entities

- **Task** — Individual task with AI-calculated priority
- **Goal** — Structured goal with SMART/RPM fields
- **FocusSession** — Pomodoro work session
- **Message/Suggestion** — AI coach interactions
- **ProductivityMetrics** — Aggregated stats

## Tips

- **Use the pre-written prompts** — They include important clarifying questions
- **Build incrementally** — Test each section before moving on
- **Write tests first** — Use the `tests.md` instructions for TDD
- **Check empty states** — Each section has specific empty state requirements
- **Review screenshots** — Match the visual design closely
